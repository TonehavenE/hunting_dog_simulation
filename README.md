# Hunting Dog Simulation
A simple python simulation of the hunting dog problem. Here is the original question:

> Waldo has two hunting dogs. One day, on the trail of some animal, Waldo comes to a place where the road forks into two paths. Waldo knows that each dog, independently of the other, will choose the correct path with probability $p$. Waldo decides to leat each dog choose a path, and if they agree, take that one, and if they disagree, Waldo randomly chooses a path for the dogs to take. Is Waldo's strategy better than just letting one of the two dogs decide on a path?

Running `hunting_dog_simulation.py` will prompt the user to input a number of paths, dogs, and the probabilities associated with those dogs. It will then run a few thousand trials and return some basic statistics about the different strategies.
